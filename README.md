# Python-Neural-Network
A very simple python neural network which processes images

Instructions:
1. Run Neural Network.py
2. Upload a BMP image. The image must be a BMP file to work properly.
3. Choose a filter you wish to apply to the image
4. Press "Process the image!" to see the result. Larger images take more time to process.
5. The result will be saved in the same folder as the python program

Have fun!
